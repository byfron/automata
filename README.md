Automata
========

Automata is a simple finite state machine header library, loosely inspired in [TinyFSM](https://github.com/digint/tinyfsm/blob/master/include/tinyfsm.hpp) but avoiding static class states. Automata aims to be efficient and small while also being a flexible library. 

Key features:

- Ease of use
- Event dispatching
- Dynamic transitions
- Multiple-instance support

Current version: `0.0.1`
